HMI UI Framework (Qt Quick / QML)

This project provides a Qt Quick (QML) based framework for developing Humanâ€“Machine Interface (HMI) applications.
It includes:
Centralized theme system (colors, fonts, spacing, scaling)
Standard UI components (buttons, text fields, menus, status indicators, dialogs)
Utility helpers for validation (IP, MAC, subnet), formatting (time, bytes, percentages), and UI behaviors
Responsive design with support for common HMI screen resolutions

The goal is to deliver a consistent, maintainable, and reusable UI foundation for industrial applications.
